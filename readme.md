# Socket List

Testing ground for learning and exploring socket.io.

### Using this project

`git clone https://github.com/Philip-Owen/socket_list.git && cd socket_list`

`npm install`

`npm start`

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. Currently, running the application will assign a "user number" to each connection and display a list of the users currently connected.
